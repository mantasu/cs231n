Nodes in the computational graph are Tensors which will hold n-dimensional arrays when the graph is run; edges in the graph represent functions that will operate on Tensors when the graph is run to actually perform useful computation.\n","\n","Before Tensorflow 2.0, we had to configure the graph into two phases. There are plenty of tutorials online that explain this two-step process. The process generally looks like the following for TF 1.x:\n","1. **Build a computational graph that describes the computation that you want to perform**. This stage doesn't actually perform any computation; it just builds up a symbolic representation of your computation. This stage will typically define one or more `placeholder` objects that represent inputs to the computational graph.\n","2. **Run the computational graph many times.** Each time the graph is run (e.g. for one gradient descent step) you will specify which parts of the graph you want to compute, and pass a `feed_dict` dictionary that will give concrete values to any `placeholder`s in the graph.\n","\n","### The new paradigm in Tensorflow 2.0\n","Now, with Tensorflow 2.0, we can simply adopt a functional form that is more Pythonic and similar in spirit to PyTorch and direct Numpy operation. Instead of the 2-step paradigm with computation graphs, making it (among other things) easier to debug TF code. You can read more details at https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager.\n","\n","The main difference between the TF 1.x and 2.0 approach is that the 2.0 approach doesn't make use of `tf.Session`, `tf.run`, `placeholder`, `feed_dict`. To get more details of what's different between the two version and how to convert between the two, check out the official migration guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/guide/migration_guide\n","\n","Later, in the rest of this notebook we'll focus on this new, simpler approach."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore"],"id":"cXI9O4PEVei2"},"source":["### TensorFlow warmup: Flatten Function\n","\n","We can see this in action by defining a simple `flatten` function that will reshape image data for use in a fully-connected network.\n","\n","In TensorFlow, data for convolutional feature maps is typically stored in a Tensor of shape N x H x W x C where:\n","\n","- N is the number of datapoints (minibatch size)\n","- H is the height of the feature map\n","- W is the width of the feature map\n","- C is the number of channels in the feature map\n","\n","This is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data.

This was fine for a small network, but could quickly become unweildy for a large complex model.\n","\n","Fortunately TensorFlow 2.0 provides higher-level APIs such as `tf.keras` which make it easy to build models out of modular, object-oriented layers. Further, TensorFlow 2.0 uses eager execution that evaluates operations immediately, without explicitly constructing any computational graphs. This makes it easy to write and debug models, and reduces the boilerplate code.\n","\n","In this part of the notebook we will define neural network models using the `tf.keras.Model` API. To implement your own model, you need to do the following:\n","\n","1. Define a new class which subclasses `tf.keras.Model`. Give your class an intuitive name that describes it, like `TwoLayerFC` or `ThreeLayerConvNet`.\n","2. In the initializer `__init__()` for your new class, define all the layers you need as class attributes. The `tf.keras.layers` package provides many common neural-network layers, like `tf.keras.layers.Dense` for fully-connected layers and `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` for convolutional layers. Under the hood, these layers will construct `Variable` Tensors for any learnable parameters. **Warning**: Don't forget to call `super(YourModelName, self).__init__()` as the first line in your initializer!\n","3. Implement the `call()` method for your class; this implements the forward pass of your model, and defines the *connectivity* of your network. Layers defined in `__init__()` implement `__call__()` so they can be used as function objects that transform input Tensors into output Tensors. Don't define any new layers in `call()`; any layers you want to use in the forward pass should be defined in `__init__()`.\n","\n","After you define your `tf.keras.Model` subclass, you can instantiate it and use it like the model functions from Part II.\n","\n","### Keras Model Subclassing API: Two-Layer Network\n","\n","Here is a concrete example of using the `tf.keras.Model` API to define a two-layer network. There are a few new bits of API to be aware of here:\n","\n","We use an `Initializer` object to set up the initial values of the learnable parameters of the layers; in particular `tf.initializers.VarianceScaling` gives behavior similar to the Kaiming initialization method we used in Part II. You can read more about it here: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/initializers/VarianceScaling\n","\n","We construct `tf.keras.layers.Dense` objects to represent the two fully-connected layers of the model. In addition to multiplying their input by a weight matrix and adding a bias vector, these layer can also apply a nonlinearity for you. For the first layer we specify a ReLU activation function by passing `activation='relu'` to the constructor; the second layer uses softmax activation function. Finally, we use `tf.keras.layers.Flatten` to flatten the output from the previous fully-connected layer."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore-input"],"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hSeu1Jq0Vejf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630085431193,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":243,"user":{"displayName":"MANTAS BIRŠKUS","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh4p74VzcLbLKZFYUnmVzxKmHhFZC9ouHcczEsEmQ=s64","userId":"00995227095641424292"}},"outputId":"e9b5aa4e-d72e-4e7e-d79d-f12a07e6ac29"},"source":["class TwoLayerFC(tf.keras.Model):\n","    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_classes):\n","        super(TwoLayerFC, self).__init__()        \n","        initializer = tf.initializers.VarianceScaling(scale=2.0)\n","        self.fc1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_size, activation='relu',\n","                                   kernel_initializer=initializer)\n","        self.fc2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax',\n","                                   kernel_initializer=initializer)\n","        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()\n","    \n","    def call(self, x, training=False):\n","        x = self.flatten(x)\n","        x = self.fc1(x)\n","        x = self.fc2(x)\n","        return x\n","\n","\n","def test_TwoLayerFC():\n","    \"\"\" A small unit test to exercise the TwoLayerFC model above. \"\"\"\n","    input_size, hidden_size, num_classes = 50, 42, 10\n","    x = tf.zeros((64, input_size))\n","    model = TwoLayerFC(hidden_size, num_classes)\n","    with tf.device(device):\n","        scores = model(x)\n","        print(scores.shape)\n","        \n","test_TwoLayerFC()"],"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["(64, 10)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TSZEAXh0Vejf"},"source":["### Keras Model Subclassing API: Three-Layer ConvNet\n","Now it's your turn to implement a three-layer ConvNet using the `tf.keras.Model` API.

You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n","  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n","  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n","  \n","### Have fun and happy training!

([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)) with the following architecture:\n","1. `CONV->NORM->RELU`\n","    * As the input is of shape `32x32x3`, initially performed a convolution with filter size `5x5` to produce `32` _activation maps_. Padding of `2` was used to preserve the input spacial area size.\n","    * The `32` _activation maps_, each of shape `32x32`, were then passed through _batchnorm_ layer and through _ReLU_ nonlinearity.\n","2. `[IDENTITY->IDENTITY]->[BOTLENECK->IDENTITY]x3`\n","    * In general each block has `2` layers, each of which perfom a _convolution_, _batchnorm_ and _ReLU_. The second layer adds together its output with block's raw input to produce the final activations. The channel size grows by a factor of `2` after each block.\n","    * Each _identity_ block doe not change the spacial area of the input, however, the _bottleneck_ block reduces the spacial size by a factor of `2`.\n","    * The 'preprocessed' input of size `32x32x32` after each block had its shape modified and its dimensions changed in the following way `32x32x64->16x16x128->8x8x256->4x4x512` (based on the provided sequence of blocks).\n","3. `POOL->SOFTMAX`\n","    * The activation maps are passed through _global average pooling_ to get the final activation shape of `1x1x512` which is then flattened to a linear classifier which produces scores based on the _Softmax_ loss function.\n","\n","> Key motivation is that by adding together the outputs of the second layer with the inputs of the first layer (per block), it allows the network to extract more features when many layers are used because the vanishing gradient problem disappears.\n","\n","### Hyperparameters\n","I did not fine-tune any parameters, simply used the provided _learning rate_ of `0.001` with already defined **Adam** optimizer."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ivIW2Cy4spU0"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
